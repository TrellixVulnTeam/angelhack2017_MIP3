Currently, alac.js works properly in the latest versions of Firefox, Chrome, and Safari.\n\n## Authors\n\nalac.js was written by [@jensnockert](http://github.com/jensnockert) and [@devongovett](http://github.com/devongovett) \nof [Audiocogs](http://audiocogs.org/).\n\n## Building\n\nWe use [browserify](https://github.com/substack/node-browserify) to build alac.js.  You can download a\nprebuilt version from the Github [releases](https://github.com/audiocogs/alac.js/releases) page. \nTo build alac.js for the browser yourself, use the following commands:\n\n    npm install\n    make browser\n    \nThis will place a built `alac.js` file, as well as a source map in the `build/` directory.\n\nalac.js depends on [Aurora.js](https://github.com/audiocogs/aurora.js), our audio codec framework.\nFor detailed information on how to use Aurora.js, check out the [documentation](https://github.com/audiocogs/aurora.js/wiki).\n\n    \n## License\n\nalac.js is released under the same terms as the original ALAC decoder from Apple, which is the \n[Apache 2](http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0) license.","maintainers":[{"name":"devongovett","email":"devongovett@gmail.com"}],"time":{"modified":"2014-06-17T18:03:19.648Z","created":"2014-06-17T18:03:19.648Z","0.1.0":"2014-06-17T18:03:19.648Z"},"homepage":"https://github.com/audiocogs/alac.js","keywords":["audio","av","aurora.js","aurora","decode"],"repository":{"type":"git","url":"git://github.com/audiocogs/alac.js"},"author":{"name":"Devon Govett","email":"devongovett@gmail.com"},"bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/audiocogs/alac.js/issues"},"license":"Apache-2.0","readmeFilename":"README.md","_attachments":{},"_etag":"W/\"53a082e7-f58\"","_lastModified":"Tue, 17 Jun 2014 18:03:19 GMT"}
